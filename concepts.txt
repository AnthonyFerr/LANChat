Concept #1 - Binding
The server needs to bind to a SPECIFIC address and port so that clients know who to connect to, so that's why it uses bind. 
Since the server isn't initializing the connection with the client, the client doesn't need to bind to an address and port. 
When I call socket, the client is being given these things dynamically by the OS.
